# Image Generation Based on Text with spaCy and PIL

This project uses `spaCy` and `PIL` to process text in Spanish, identify key words, and generate images based on the words, numbers, and special characters found. The goal is to allow the visualization of text as images, which is useful in educational contexts, accessibility systems, and other applications requiring the conversion of text into graphics.

## What does this project do?

This script takes a text input, analyzes it using natural language processing (NLP), and produces a combined image representing the detected words and numbers. The project:

- Identifies nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other grammatical categories.
- Generates specific images for words and numbers based on part-of-speech (POS) tags.
- Creates a final image that combines the images of words and characters present in the text.
- Adapts pre-existing images for each word or generates letter images if a specific image is not found.

## Why is this project useful?

This project is useful for various applications, such as:

- Education: Helps visualize words and phrases in Spanish, which can improve language comprehension for students or people with special needs.
- Accessibility: Provides a graphical way to represent text, useful for systems that convert text into images for users with visual or learning disabilities.
- Text analysis: It’s a flexible tool to visually display words in a text and their grammatical analysis, useful in research projects or data analysis.

## Getting started with the project

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) for natural language processing.
- [Pillow (PIL)](https://python-pillow.org/) for image manipulation.
- [unidecode](https://pypi.org/project/Unidecode/) for text normalization.

### Installation
Follow these steps to install and run the project:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/youruser/your-repository.git
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the Spanish model for `spaCy`:
    ```bash 
    python -m spacy download es_core_news_sm
4. Make sure to have the images for words and letters organized in the corresponding folders (`Palabras/` and `Letters/`).

### Running the Project

1. Modify the input text in the Python file to any sentence you want to use: 
    ```python 
    text = "Tengo 27 años, mi hermana tiene 25 y mi padre tiene 55 años"
2. Run the script to process the text and generate the final image: 
    ```bash
    python TextToImgMSL_1.0.0.py
3. The generated image will be available in the `Pruebas\` folder under the name `classification.jpg.`

### POS (Part-of-Speech) Tags

The project uses the part-of-speech (POS) tags generated by the spaCy model to identify different types of words in the text. Here are the main tags used in the script and what they represent:

- ADJ (Adjective): Words that describe characteristics or qualities of nouns, like colors or sizes (e.g., blue, big).
- ADP (Adposition): Words that indicate relationships between other words, like with, without, in.
- ADV (Adverb): Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, indicating how an action is performed (e.g., quickly).
- AUX (Auxiliary verb): Verbs that accompany other verbs to form compound tenses (e.g., to have, to be).
- CCONJ (Coordinating conjunction): Words that connect phrases or clauses of equal importance, like and, or.
- DET (Determiner): Words that introduce nouns and express quantity or possession, like the, a, my.
- INTJ (Interjection): Short words or phrases expressing emotions or reactions, like oh, ah.
- NOUN (Noun): Words that name people, animals, things, or ideas (e.g., child, book).
- NUM (Number): Cardinal numbers, such as one, two, 27.
- PART (Particle): Functional words that don’t fit easily into other grammatical categories and modify or clarify (e.g., not in "do not").
- PRON (Pronoun): Words that substitute for nouns, like he, she, we.
- PROPN (Proper noun): Specific names of people, places, or institutions (e.g., John, Mexico).
- SCONJ (Subordinating conjunction): Words that introduce subordinate clauses, like because, although.
- PUNCT (Punctuation): Punctuation marks like . (period) or , (comma).

These tags allow the script to identify the words in the text and determine which image or letter to use to visualize them.

### Images by POS Category

In this version of the project, there are 893 words classified and associated with images, distributed as follows:
- ADJ (Adjective): 194 images
- ADP (Adposition): 10 images
- ADV (Adverb): 34 images
- AUX (Auxiliary verb): 3 images
- CCONJ (Coordinating conjunction): 3 images
- DET (Determiner): 14 images
- INTJ (Interjection): 4 images
- NOUN (Noun): 358 images
- NUM (Number): 39 images
- PRON (Pronoun): 15 images
- PROPN (Proper noun): 21 images
- VERB (Verb): 198 images

### Special Word with Specific URL
A special word in this project is **"con"**. This word is associated with a specific URL, placing it in the adposition category. The URL is the following:
`Palabras/CategoriaGramatical(POS)/Preposicion/Con_.JPG`

The word **"con"** is a reserved Windows word referring to `Console`.

### Categories Not Used
- PART (Particle): This category is not used in the current project as there are no words that fit this tag. In future versions, specific particles could be included to fulfill this function.

### Words Added through Patterns
Some words in the text may have been incorrectly classified by the `spaCy` model. To correct this, words in patterns have been added using the `matcher` function. This functionality allows redefining the classification of words that don’t fit perfectly into a standard grammatical category or require personalized handling within the program flow.

For example, if a word is incorrectly labeled as a noun when it should be a verb, the `matcher` function can correct this error to ensure that text processing is as accurate as possible.

## Source of Images
The images used in this version of the project were obtained from the following document:

- **Manos con Voz: Diccionario de Lengua de Señas Mexicana**  
    - Author: Consejo Nacional para Prevenir la Discriminación (CONAPRED)
    - URL: https://www.conapred.org.mx/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ManosconVoz_2011_Ax.pdf

    This dictionary contains an extensive visual catalog of signs in Mexican Sign Language (LSM), which has been fundamental in generating the images associated with words and grammatical tags (POS) in this project.
